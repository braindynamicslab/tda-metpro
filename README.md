System requirements:
This software was made and tested on a desktop computer (Mac OS) running Matlab 2019+

Installation guide:
1. Just go the main folder in Matlab and run the bdl_taskfMRI_postfMRIPrep_v1_MetPro file to postprocess fMRIPrep output and get parcellated data as Input for Mapper.

2. Run monique_mapper_Sep21_2021.m file to run Mapper on the data and to extract participation coefficient etc for the main results in the paper. This file also implements the modeling framework.
